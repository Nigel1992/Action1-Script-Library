# Action1 RMM Script Library

This repository contains a collection of custom scripts designed for use with [Action1 RMM](https://www.action1.com), a cloud-based remote monitoring and management platform. These scripts help automate common IT administration, maintenance, security, and monitoring tasks.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Scripts are organized in a two-level folder structure:

- **By Functionality Category**
  - `maintenance/`
  - `software/`
  - `network/`
  - `security/`
  - `inventory/`
  - `utilities/`

- **By Script Language**
  - `powershell/` – Scripts written in PowerShell (`.ps1`)
  - `cmd/` – Windows Command Line (`.bat`, `.cmd`)
  - `vbs/` – Visual Basic Scripts (`.vbs`)
  - `bash/` – Linux/macOS scripts (`.sh`) for cross-platform use (where applicable)

### Example:
maintenance/
├── powershell/
│ └── ClearTempFiles.ps1
├── cmd/
│ └── DiskCleanup.cmd

software/
├── powershell/
│ └── InstallChrome.ps1
